SMiLer: A Semi-Lazy Time Series Prediction System for Sensors
===

SMiLer is a SeMiLazy time series prediction system for sensors. The overall framework of SMiLer comprising of two main steps: search step and prediction step. More details about it can be found in the paper: 

Jingbo Zhou, Anthony K. H. Tung; "SMiLer: A Semi-Lazy Time Series Prediction System for Sensors"; Proc. of 2015 ACM Int. Conf. on Management of Data (SIGMOD 2015)

#### Quick Run
You can see a running example in the folder "src/demo". The demo also give a brief introudction about the API and parameters.

####Dependencies
The current code depends on the following external libraries:

Armadillo (http://arma.sourceforge.net/), is a high quality C++ linear algebra library

OpenBLAS (optional, http://www.openblas.net/), is an optimized BLAS library. OpenBLAS is not mandatory, but it helps Armadillo achieve better performance.
(You also can use BLAS, ATLAS and LAPACK together to replace the OpenBLAS.)
